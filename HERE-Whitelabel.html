            <h3 class="panel-heading panel-title">What? Why?</h3>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>Back in 2017, the HERE WeGo app was one of the most popular navigation apps. Previously owned by Nokia and released under other names such as Nokia Maps or HERE Maps, the company was acquired in 2015 by a consortium formed by three German car manufactorers - Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW - with the goal of providing better car dashboard navigation and foster research about autonomous driving, as this app was pioneer in high-resolution navigation (lane-by-lane).</p>
                <p>The mobile apps division was still important, as the same navigation systems powering the embedded systems for cars was also present in the apps and tested by millions of people around the world. Such reach was essential to ensure the stability of the navigation systems, besides, the apps used the HERE SDK which was also sold as a service for several other businesses.</p>
                <p>To increase profitability, the Product Team came up with the idea of offering White-label version of the HERE WeGo app, allowing companies that didn't have enough resources to implement an app from scratch using the HERE SDK to have their own navigation app by just providing assets such as images, colours and texts.</p>
                <p>Such assets would be used during the build process and our CI/CD systems would automatically deploy all the partner brands every time the HERE WeGo app was updated.</p>

        <article class="panel panel-primary">
            <h3 class="panel-heading panel-title">Technical Details</h3>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>The iOS version was developed using Objective-C for most layers. The HERE SDK was developed mostly in C++, with a thin Objective-C++ layer.</p>
                <p>The CI/CD setup was powered by Jenkins and all the jobs were created using CI-as-code in Groovy language. The build scripts were written in Ruby code (prior to Fastlane) and everything was automated including the on-premises lab where dozens of physical devices would run automated tests 24h/day.</p>
                <p>Whenever a new customer would join the white-label program, they would have a web interface to customise the colours and strings, and upload the assets. That would create a bundle containing a YAML file and several folder holding the images and translation files. The bundle would be used during the build and the final app would have custom bundle ID, provisioning profile, assets and colours.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest challenge was that the app bundle ID was an identifier to several of our third-party libraries and partners, such as public transport companies offering real-time bus and train information. For the white-label versions several of these integrations were either disabled or customised according to the client contract. So we had to ensure that those integrations were under feature toggles and during the CI build we would inject these flags depending on the client conditions.</p>

        <article class="panel panel-primary">
            <h3 class="panel-heading panel-title">Execution and Outcome</h3>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>The team responsible for this project was formed by 3 Android and 3 iOS engineers, a Product Owner, a (manual) QA engineer and an agile coach. We had a very tight deadline to deliver this project as the company wanted to launch it during a very important tech event.</p>
                <p>Despite of the complexity and several challenges, the white-label version was finished in time for the event and the whole infrastructure was ready to receive new clients.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately due to miscommunication between Product Team and the event organisers, the white-label was never presented in the tech event, having a very quiet launch some months later.</p>
                <p>Right after that the company strategy changed and the apps entered maintenance mode, abandoning any new development and also the white-label project.</p>
                <p>Since then, the apps were removed from the mobile stores, and years later new apps were launched again. The apps currently in the AppStore and PlayStore are not the same native app described in this article, but instead, they are new apps written using cross-platform languages and tools and don't offer the same performance or usability that the native apps used to offer.</p>
