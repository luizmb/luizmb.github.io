                <p>App for students and professors from the brazilian university Senac, on which users can check the class schedules
                    and rooms, and also be notified in case of a last-minute change, such as a professor absence or a different
                    room than usual.</p>
                <p>Developed for iOS by Luiz Barbosa, team also had Senac professors Thiago Claro (backend API, database and
                    project owner) and Gabriel Andery (Android development and design).</p>
                <p>The development process for iOS happened between April and June of 2017, being released at the AppStore on
                    the 4th of July, 2017.</p>
                <p>The app is available only in Portuguese for any device running iOS 9.0 or newer, and for most Android devices.

        <article class="panel panel-primary">
            <h3 class="panel-heading panel-title">Technical Details</h3>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>iOS version was developed fully in Swift 3.0 and Xcode 8.3.3 using Fastlane tools for automation and Carthage
                    as package manager.</p>
                <p>The third-party libraries and tools used were:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Alamofire</b>: for all HTTPS requests, but not for JSON parsing due to the complex deserialization
                            rules;
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Realm</b>: local database keeping the list of courses, semesters and messages;</li>
                        <li><b>SimulatorStatusMagic</b>: for nice AppStore screenshots;</li>
                        <li><b>ENSwiftSideMenu</b>: most of this side menu code was rewritten, however the basic idea is still
                            there, and also its blur effects;</li>
                        <li><b>Acknowledgements</b>: script that generates a plist from LICENSE files on disk, helpful for "About"
                            screens;
                        </li>
                        <li><b>SwiftGen</b>: nice code generation tool, ideal for creating enums out of AssetCatalog's UIImage,
                            UIFont, colors, Localizable Strings and much more.</li>
                        <li><b>Crashlytics</b>: crash logs.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>The app was split in several layers:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Model layer</b>: has some Plain-Old-Swift-Objects and some subclasses of RealmObject, having protocols
                            for all of them to make the library totally decoupled.</li>
                        <li><b>Service layer</b>: is divided in different categories, such as:
                            <ol>
                                <li>RemoteService: the backend-API client</li>
                                <li>LocalService: local storage containers</li>
                                <li>SyncService: responsible for keeping LocalService and RemoteService in sync, acting as a
                                    proxy for every entity access and using cached version (Realm) while a remote version
                                    is being requested if needed, and notifying about local changes if a newer version is
                                    fetched from the web</li>
                                <li>JsonParser: entity mapping for parsing the document body in every request.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Dependency injection layer</b>: maps protocols to concrete class factories, setting the strategy
                            (singleton, local instance) and using protocol extension to inject the dependencies, inspired
                            by the first approach of <a href="http://www.danielhall.io/a-swift-y-approach-to-dependency-injection"
                                target=_blank>this article here.</a></li>
                        <li><b>Coordinator layer</b>: this layer replaces the usual navigation in an iOS app and keeps a slighly
                            different lifecycle that usually iOS apps have. There are several articles explaining Coordinator
                            pattern, but I have my own version of it which is serving me pretty well for all my apps and
                            I will write more about that in the future. In this app I also tried something new that worked
                            really well: inspired by <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E49-deep-linking-at-kickstarter"
                                target=_blank>the amazing Swift Talk episode #49, about Kickstarter Deep Linking strategy</a>,
                            I created navigation router as a tree of enums, some methods that can find the best route between
                            two points and then Coordinators can tell if they know how to handle a destination or they delegate
                            this task for their parent ones. Doing that, I can deal with deep linking, push notification
                            and 3D Touch starts pretty well, regardless whether or not the app is currently open and in a
                            deep level. Coordinators then will take care of proper UIViewController stack. Coordinators are
                            also responsible for the transition between two ViewControllers, but the animation itself will
                            be inside the UIView and the Coordinator will only check if any of the transition members implements
                            the protocol for entrance or exit action, and in that case, tells that class to trigger whatever
                            it wants to trigger, like an animation.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>ViewController layer</b>: no routing code is allowed here, no hardcoded dependencies (only injected
                            ones by using ghost protocols), and also no User Interface code, which means colors, animations,
                            sizes. Also, no business workflow happens here, they should be inside Model or Service layers.
                            ViewControllers are basically Thin Controller that glue everything but doing no real job. They
                            own UIViews, other child ViewControllers, and they are owned by Coordinators. They are not aware
                            of coordinator and they don't have any explicit property pointing to coordinators, but they usually
                            have a Delegate weak property of type "MyViewControllerDelegate" and, usually, they are pointing
                            to Coordinators. But ViewControllers don't know that. In case of tables or collection views,
                            ViewControllers are also not allowed to be DataSource for those, once we have a layer to handle
                            that.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>DataSource layer</b>: There are two kinds of classes here:
                            <ol>
                                <li>DataProvider: no UIKit specific code, so it's basically a 2D data set with sections vs. rows,
                                    texts and objects for a combination of them. It's generic, so the objects can be of any
                                    kind, but strongly-typed. Doesn't know anything about TableView, CollectionView or any
                                    UIKit code, and for that reason is easier to be tested and can be reused by two different
                                    DataSources, one TableViewDataSource and another CollectionViewDataSource.</li>
                                <li>DataSource: it's the class that implements UICollectionViewDataSource or UITableViewDataSource.
                                    It holds a DataProvider and returns row and section count directly from the DataProvider.
                                    However, when a cell for an index path is requested, it asks DataProvider for the model
                                    object but does the "dequeue cell" job and then binds data into the cell.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>View layer</b>: coordinator pattern works well with Storyboards but not very well with segues.
                            It works but actually you lose your flexibility and most of Coordinator pattern benefits. Storyboards
                            also bring some other problems, such as merge conflicts and worse change log compared to multiple
                            files for each view. For that reason I usually prefer XIBs over Storyboards, and usually several
                            small reusable views composing a top-level one, or in other words, spreading one screen in multiple
                            XIB files, some of them I can even reuse among different projects. Each XIB has a peer class
                            that inherits UIView or other controls such as UITableView, UIButton, UILabel, UICollectionViewCell
                            and so on. Important here: IBOutlet and IBAction are linked to the UIView class, not to the ViewController,
                            and they are
                            <u>ALWAYS PRIVATE</u>. That means two things:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Every View class has a delegate protocol for reporting its events to whoever may concern,
                                    such as ViewControllers;
                                </li>
                                <li>Every View class has one or more methods called "update with". Parameters allowed for these
                                    "update" functions are: native types or ViewModels. A ViewModel should be value type
                                    (enum or struct) and only hold other native or ViewModel types, although a deep tree
                                    is not really recommended. Last but not least, dates and numbers should be passed as
                                    strings, already with the proper formatting, from the ViewController, regardless if update
                                    function receives the String or a ViewModel containing the String. A View should never
                                    know how to format or translate strings.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Backend has an endpoint that returns last updates for each entity, and we keep these dates inside the tables
                    of our local Realm database so we can compare if some tables need to be synchronized. In that case we
                    fetch the data set for that entity, replace into local database, update the reference date and notify
                    whoever holds instances or lists of that entity. For future releases it's planned to move from this endpoint
                    to a native HTTP caching mechanism, such as HTTP Etag or HTTP Last-Modified.</p>
                <p>All endpoints are read-only, use GET method and return JSON documents. Several improvements are planned for
                    future versions regarding HTTP communication.</p>
